<h1>Project 3 in Techdegree. Treehouse Responsive Form</h1>
<br>
<p>In this project, I build a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form using a wide variety of HTML form input types and attributes. Using the supplied mockup files, I build a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries, and a "mobile-first" approach.</p>

  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Media Queries</li>
  <li>Testing and debugging</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Finally, I learned how to write all of the HTML and CSS by myself. Since using a mobile-first approach, I learned that media queries has important role in creating responsive website, that has a fitness on the tablet and desktop versions. I also learn thatt it is very important that responsive images work. While adding my own HTML and CSS, some issues came up, and I used the Dev Tools to debug and test the code I added</p>.
