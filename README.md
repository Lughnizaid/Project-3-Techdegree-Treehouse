<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this project, I built a responsive page by using a mobile-first approach. By focusing first on the mobile version and then added breakpoints using media queries for the larger screen sizes. The layout accommodates small, medium, and large screen sizes. I was tasked to build the website with all the HTML and CSS myself by using the provided mockups as a guide.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
